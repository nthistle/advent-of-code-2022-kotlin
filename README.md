# Advent of Code 2022 in Kotlin

[My attempt at writing Kotlin solutions for Advent of Code 2022](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2022/11/advent-of-code-2022-in-kotlin/). I saw that JetBrains
was sponsoring AoC and a sort of side-competition / incentives to write in Kotlin, and I figured it had been a while since I had learned a language anyways so I
might as well give it a go. Keep in mind that I don't know _any_ Kotlin going into this, so my code probably isn't going to be very idiomatic.

I'm probably not going to get around to solving every day in Kotlin, particularly days [16](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/16) and
[19](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/19), but I'll see how far I get, and will keep writing and adding solutions as I remember to and have free time.
